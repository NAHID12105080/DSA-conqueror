# convert a number to char 
```cpp
s[i] = char('0' + v);
```
-  is used to convert an integer `v` (in the range `0-9`) to its corresponding character representation
- and then store it in the `i`-th position of a string `s`.
### example:
convert the integer 3 into its character representation in a string:

```cpp
int v = 3;
s[i] = char('0' + v);
```
